The script `test.py` is the final script where we calculate the average of predictions and where we have utilized ngrok.

The scripts that start with `work_<FIRSTNAME>` are the scripts where we have trained our models (KNN, GMM, SVM).

The scripts that end with `_app` are the scripts where we have created APIs for each model.
